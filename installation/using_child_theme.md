# Using Child Theme

A [Child Theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) is used to make some changes to CSS styles or functionality of the theme and you want to keep receiving updates of the main theme.

You can install a Child theme the same way you have installed you main {{ book.themename }} theme – via FTP or via WordPress admin panel. It comes with blank files, so you should add your custom code directly to Child Theme files to make changes appear on your site. These changes won't be overwritten during {{ book.themename }} updates.

There are no disadvantages of not using a Child Theme if you have no plans to modify the Main Theme. A Child Theme is just an option we offer – it’s not mandatory.

You can also apply your custom CSS, HTML, JavaScript code via theme options for entire site or for particular pages, please read corresponding article, these changes won't be overwritten during {{ book.themename }} updates.
