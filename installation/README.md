# Installation

Installing the theme can be done in two ways. You can upload the theme ZIP file using the built in WordPress theme upload, or copy the files through an FTP client.

1. [**Using WordPress Theme Upload**](using_wordpress_theme_upload.md)
2. [**Uploading by FTP**](uploading_by_ftp.md)

<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Important:</strong> Be sure to extract the file <strong>"{{ book.themeslug }}.zip"</strong> from the ThemeForest download before uploading. Using the ThemeForest ZIP file directly will result in a "Missing Style Sheet" error.</div>

### Activate the theme

Once the theme is uploaded, activate it from **Appearance > Themes** by clicking the **"Activate"** link for **"{{ book.themename }}"**.

After you have activated the theme. You need to install the plugins that are required and recommended to use with the theme.
