# Uploading by FTP

1. Login to your FTP server and navigate to your WordPress themes directory.
2. Normally this would be "**wp-content/themes**"
3. Extract the files from the zipped theme available in the package downloaded from ThemeForest.
4. Copy the folder "**{{ book.themeslug }}**" to your themes directory.
5. After the files finish uploading, login to your WordPress admin.
6. In the **"Appearance"** menu click **"Themes"**
7. Click **"Activate"** for the theme **"{{ book.themename }}"**

### Recommended Additional Step

We highly recommend the use of child themes. The additional step involves repeating steps 1 to 7 for **{{ book.themeslug }}-child.zip** file
